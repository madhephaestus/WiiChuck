sentence=Control many servos without delay.
paragraph=Control many servos without delay or interrupts while applying rotation adjustments with PWM/PPM. Quickly calibrate each servo and make real-time adjustments to the rotation with moveToDegrees(). Connect as many servos as the number of digital pins available on your Arduino. This library is very fast and has a small, lightweight code footprint.
