ProTrinketKeyboard is Adafruit's Pro Trinket USB HID Arduino Library

ProTrinketKeyboard allows the user to implement a simple USB keyboard using an Adafruit Pro Trinket (ATmega 328P based)

Please see ProTrinketKeyboard.h for usage documentation, examples are also included

ProTrinketKeyboard uses V-USB (http://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/) to implement USB with a bitbang technique. See the folder "usbdrv" for V-USB files.

Adafruit's Pro Trinket can do almost anything that V-USB can do, including USB mouse, keyboards, joysticks, gamepads, MIDI devices, and much more (including custom devices that do not fit any existing category).
